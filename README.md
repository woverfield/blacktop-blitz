# Blacktop Blitz

Blacktop Blitz is a React application designed to help NBA 2K players quickly generate and draft teams for the Blacktop game mode. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, Blacktop Blitz makes team creation fun, fast, and efficient.

## Features

- **Random Team Generation:** Generate random teams based on selected criteria.
- **Player Database:** Utilizes Web-Scraped NBA2k player data for accurate ratings and players.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Scripts

There are some web scraping scripts that I made to get player data: https://github.com/woverfield/2k-web-scraping. I also included the files in this repo alongside with some other scripts to update the players and combine the 3 rosters (current, classic, all-time) into one json file.
